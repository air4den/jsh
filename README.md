# Jsh - Josh Shell!

I built __Jsh__, a simple shell to up my C skills and learn more operating systems concepts! I followed Stephen Brennan's [article](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) from his great blog. 

## Build & Run
`make run` OR `make build` to build and  `./jsh` to run. 

## Features
Functions
- cd - change current working directory
- help - gives info about __Jsh__
- wtgw - THWg
- exit
